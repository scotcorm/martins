                    <p class="paragraph">God has designed all of us to be alike in many ways. However, there are particular features of our individual lives that prepare us to relate with and get connected to some people better than we might with others. For example, men and women are alike in hundreds of ways. Nevertheless there are challenges that each gender faces that are unique to that gender. Therefore it can be fruitful to provide gender-specific programming from time to time. The same goes for age-specific programming, parent-oriented programming, and programming for many other demographic groupings</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Through the various ministries of Rhema Life, we seek; therefore, to cultivate a diverse array of communities, each providing programs, discipleship, and care designed to help to you in your own specific context.</p>

It's our heart that they know Him, encounter Him, and adore Him. Children learn to know Him through the Word; they encounter Him through His presence, and adore Him through a life surrendered.</p>
                                <p class="white paragraph">We impart the Word of God to the children by teaching with a systematic approach where they are able to hear it, see it, say it, and do it. We create an environment where the Holy Spirit is welcome and the children are positioned to encounter God's manifest presence. Worship, soaking, dancing, prophetic art, prayer, and prophecy are just some of the many ways that His presence is manifest revealing the Father's love for them.</p>

We want to meet not only the spiritual needs of our students but also physical, emotional, and day to day needs as well. Most of all, we want to provide a solid foundation of scriptural truths, support and Godly encouragement for our students to stand on as they face the struggles and joys that college life brings. Whether our students are states away from family or simply blocks away, we want to be their home-away-from-home… For more information regarding the College Ministry, email RhemaCollege@rhemalifeministry.org</p>

The outreach provides experiences with God that impact each child in a life changing way as they discover that their true identity and destiny is found in Jesus Christ alone.</p>
                                <p class="white paragraph pad-bottom10">Children need to understand that Christianity is based on more than accumulation of knowledge in their minds. It is important that they be given opportunities to actively and personally experience that the promises of God are true. If we are to advance the Kingdom of God, we must all move from the place of receiving ministry to actively ministering to others. With this in mind, every student is given opportunities to be trained through Accelerated Ministry Training (AMT) sessions. They are then released to minister to others in their choice of outreach ministries during the week, conferences, church services, and mission’s trips. This generation is tired of hearing about Joshua; they're ready to be Joshua generation!</p>
                                <p class="white paragraph pad-bottom0">In addition to ministry training, each student learns the importance of core values of Kingdom Kids: Honor, Intimacy with Christ, Purity, and the Word of God. The outreach is in session between May and August each year. Applications and tuition information is available from January of each year. For more information on the outreach, please email Kids@rhemalifeministry.org.</p>

To that end we endeavor not only to spend time together having fun, but also in reaching out to our community and to each other. Our goal is to challenge each other to be the men God created us to be, fulfilling our purposes within our families, on our jobs, and in the church. In addition to that we are always mindful that we are an integral part of our community. We welcome the responsibilities God has placed in our hands while prayerfully submitting to His will for our lives.

                                <p class="white">Every Tuesday in Rhema Life Fellowship Hall at 6:15 AM. Meet other men for coffee, donuts and prayer. During the meetings one of the men of our group will share a testimony or teach a brief Bible lesson.</p>
                                <p class="white">On the first Tuesday of each month we enjoy a BIG breakfast consisting of bacon, eggs, biscuits and gravy. This is also the week when we usually have a special guest speaker. Our goals as we meet are to build each other up in the Lord, lift up those around us in need of prayer, and to learn more about God's Word.</p>

Women are also encouraged to be committed to teaching the younger women, as outlined in Titus 2:4.<br /><br />For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. You will seek Me and find Me, when you seek Me with all your heart. Jeremiah 29:11-13</p>

                    <p>Fellowship is a large part of our growth as a class and individually.</p>
                    <p>1 John 1:3-4 explains the importance of fellowship in the Christian walk. It says, "What we have seen and heard we also declare to you, so that you may have fellowship along with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. We are writing these things so that our joy may be complete." </p>
                    <p class="pad-bottom30">To have fellowship with one another is more complex than just sharing food, laughter, and friendship. True fellowship is the sharing of God’s blessings in a mutual relationship with the Father through Jesus Christ, the Son. As we grow together in fellowship with Christ we also grow in fellowship with each other. We invite you to fellowship with us during our planned fellowship events. .
