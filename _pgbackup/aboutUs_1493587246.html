When we look back at the past few years, we could testify of stabilization and strategic advancement in the kingdom. Our ministry has grown in size and diversity, our leadership structure has changed, we have a much better established Sunday classic Ministration, Bible study, small group meetings etc that emphasis on care and spiritual growth, and we continue to see development in our other various ministries. Of course, the greatest thrill is watching God change lives. Some who are part of our church family today were not even followers of Jesus months back. Rhema life has been a good ground to walk in seeing souls won and lives changed to the Glory of God.</p>

                                <p class="white pad25">It is still God's policy to work through us and change our world and create in us a fulfilling future. This is one of life's greatest mysteries to us: that God would choose us to work out his change in this world through us. And it is this great zeal that God has called us to work in Rhema life Ministry. The early followers of Jesus believed this about themselves. In Acts 1:8 they were promised power when the Holy Spirit came upon them, and that they would be Jesus' witnesses in their city, region, and all around the world. They knew first-hand that the gospel, a relationship with Jesus, was the power of God to transform all who believe. That is why they were called "the ones who turned the world upside down" in Acts 17:6.</p>
                                <p class="white">We at Rhema Life have been given that same authority to transform lives in our region and the world in general.  The degree to which we are changing our region and our world for God has indicated the degree of our effectiveness over the vision that is before us. We see lives changed, families changed, neighborhoods, workplaces, and communities impacted because of our presence.</p>

                                <p>Just as every person God creates is unique and has some very special qualities, so it is with churches as well....At Rhema Life, one of the things that make us unique is our commitment to three core goals.</p>
                                <p>When I became a pastor, I really didn't know what to do.  However, in struggling to find out what I should really focus on, as a pastor, the Lord spoke to me to do these three things and build a church upon three simple goals.  He said in essence, "if you want to build a great church that will always grow, then do these three things:  <strong>Love people, unconditionally</strong>.  <strong>Teach people, uncompromisingly</strong>.  <strong>And Encourage people, unceasingly</strong>.  It is upon these core foundations that we welcome you to the Rhema Life family!  This means focusing on three different-yet-intertwined areas of our mission.</p>

                            <p class="paragraph">Everything God does begins with a seed...and years ago, God planted in the heart of Rev Donbruce a vision for a church that would teach people the practical, life-changing principles of the Bible. Out of obedience to God and his passion to share God's unconditional love for people, Rev Donbruce moved to Singapore and began preaching the Word of God. What was first incorporated as a church in June of 2005, has now grown into today's Rhema Life Ministry --one of the fastest growing and diverse churches around the world, we have our Headquarter in Boca Raton, Florida, and our Asia Headquarter in Singapore.  We have also started new satellite Ministries in Africa, China, Australia, Canada, and France</p>
                            <p>Over the past years Rhema Life has lived up to its name by seeing untold thousands of lives changed. Through thriving church programs, an expanding ministry, Community Life, outreaches and missions, the impact is far-reaching with no end in sight! </p>
                            <p>Our newly strategies ministry on campus will serve as the launching pad for us to birth satellite campuses around South Florida , and throughout the world, we have started a Rhema school of Ministry to train leaders, and also allowing us to continue changing lives and reaching nations with the Father's love, by teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. Rhema life Ministry is reaching people and changing lives through the understanding of God's Word, building them into the likeness of Jesus Christ.</p>
                            <p>As Rhema Life Ministry joyfully looks forward to the next few years ahead, we would consider it an honor to have you be a part of what God is doing in Rhema life today. What makes us unique is the Vision, mission, that God gave us.</p>

To become a church where nobody stands alone. We want people to know their right standing in life and to become what God has predestined and planned for them.  A place, where there is always a seat for everybody in respective of who they are, where they come from. We are the body of Christ, the family of God, a community of followers devoted to Christ and his cause, a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that we should be holy and without blemish.  A community of praise. We want to see the entire church comes together as one big family of God. Ephesians 5:27 Psalms 145:4, Matthew 28:19-20</p>

                        <p class="text-left white margin-top5 pad10">There are three important questions we can use to focus our spiritual lens, individually and as a church. &nbsp;These three questions represent three of the essential values of our church: evangelism, decipleship and service. &nbsp;</p>

                                <h4>QUESTION #1: DO YOU KNOW JESUS CHRIST?</h4>
                                <p class="pad-bottom45 text-left">We want people to receive Jesus  Christ and experience forgiveness and new life in him. Our desire is to  introduce people to a real and personal relationship with Jesus Christ so that  they can experience the transforming power of his love. Christ commanded that we "go  and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and  of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." (Matthew28:19)<br /> Therefore, we seek to  reach out to the spiritually lost with the positive, life-changing good news of  the gospel in our public worship and special events, through need meeting  ministries and Christian education classes for all ages and needs.</p>

                                <h4>QUESTION #2: HAVE YOU BECOME A DISCIPLE?</h4>
                                <p class="text-left">Jesus said, "Come, follow  me." A disciple is one who seeks to follow and live in loving obedience to Christ. He told his followers to make disciples by "teaching them to obey everything" that he had commanded them.(Matthew 28:20) We seek to help  people follow Christ and live in obedience to Him. The goal is to reach spiritual maturity through continual learning, application and growth. <br />
                                We want Christians to become  established and grow to maturity in their faith. Therefore, we are providing  many different discipleship opportunities: new believer's training, pastors and  leaders welcome class for church membership, for ongoing growth and development  and one-to-one discipleship.</p>

                                <h4>QUESTION #3: HAVE YOU FOUND A MINISTRY?</h4>
                                <p class="pad10 pad-bottom90 text-left">God gifts special talents and abilities  to  every Christian, to be used for His work. The  Apostle Paul confirmed this in his letter to the Romans, chapter 12, verses  4-6. "Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members  do not all have the same function, so in Christ we who are many form one body,  and each member belongs to all the others. We have different gifts, according  to the grace given us." The discovery and use of these gifts make a tremendous difference in our lives, and the lives of others.</p>
