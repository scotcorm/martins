                <p class="paragraph">A small group is a place where people gather in Christ's name on a regular basis to experience the transforming power of Jesus Christ through vital prayer, the application of the Bible to daily life and close caring friendships. Small groups have been an important part of Christian life from the beginning of the church. "Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved." (Acts 2:46-47) Small groups provide an opportunity for people to be known, loved and accepted. In larger groups it is easy to get lost in the crowd. However, the small group offers a sense of community and the likelihood of establishing lifelong friendships. Small group is compulsory for all members because it makes you connect to the church.</p>

Most Acts 2 Groups use the weekly lesson, which is written to correspond with the topic and scriptures, used for the weekend sermon. However, Acts 2 Groups are free to use other study materials that fit their group as long as they secure the approval of their pastoral leader.</p>

                            <p class="pad10">The uniquely identifying characteristic of all these Acts 2 Groups is that they seek to emphasize each of the four areas in the "values circle:" Sharing Life, Seeking God, Growing spiritually and Serving Others. Acts 2 Groups are the best single ministry activity for helping each member participate in fulfilling the mission, vision and values of our church. (Review the Introduction to Ministry section to see where 2 Groups Acts fit in our Mission, Vision, Values and Strategy).</p>
